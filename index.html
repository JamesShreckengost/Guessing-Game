    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am James Shreckengost Jr. I am from Hayward, California located in the Bay Area. In high school my main focus was football. I played middle linebacker and tight end. My junior year of high school, I received second team all league honors and my senior year, I received 1st team all league honors. After I tore my shoulder and couldn’t play anymore, I went to Menlo College for one semester which didn’t work out. After, I choose to work in the warehouse industry because I knew you didn’t have to have much experience. I have focused my efforts all into coding since the beginning 2020. Now I am here at Code Fellows.
